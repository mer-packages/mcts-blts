Test Environment Setup
-----------------------
This package is designed to do fully automated tests for various device 
drivers in your netbook, so it is recommended to setup those devices 
at first, or some tests would fail for lack of device. Here is a installation
 guide to setup devices for your reference.

1. Connect ethernet cable.
2. Insert one bluetooth dangle if you don't have internal bluetooth in your netbook.
3. Insert one sd card(skip this if you don't have card reader).
4. Insert one usb hub
5. Insert usb keyboard, usb mouse to the hub
6. Insert usb ethernet to usb hub

In step 5,6, you can also insert those usb devices into other netbook usb ports, 
just ensure those usb devices are there.

-----------------------
Known Issues
-----------------------
1. Some usb/sd card cases(create/delete_partition_* etc.) would fail occasionally, 
a simple work around is to delete all partitions and then unplug/plug them manually, 
it could work.


-----------------------
TODO
-----------------------
1. more cases are under development, they will be included in the futrue.
