Overview

This package contains several OpenVG function & performance testing  for generic
Linux-y mobile platforms.

Note: At present, This suite is not support testrunner or testkit framework
      Run blts-openvg-tests binary directly.


Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * libbltscommon >= 0.2.4
  * OpenVG
  * EGL

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.
You'll also need the Check test framework (v. 0.9+) to run the unit tests
and use the provided Autoconf scripts.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
