Overview

This package contains several X11 functionality tests for generic
Linux-y mobile platforms.


Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * xlib
  * libXrandr

Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.
You'll also need the Check test framework (v. 0.9+) to run the unit tests
and use the provided Autoconf scripts.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

Or, 
 $ run "./pack.sh" directly
 $ blts-display-test-0.0.11-1.i386.rpm should be generated 
   in /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/
 $ rpm -ivh /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/blts-display-test-0.0.11-1.i386.rpm
 $ After installation, /usr/bin/blts-display-test and /usr/share/blts-display-test/tests.xml 
   should be available.
