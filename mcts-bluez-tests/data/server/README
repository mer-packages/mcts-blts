Bluez auto test system server side configuration guide

The only thing you need to do is to start script server_startup.sh in session user.
$ ./server_startup.sh

When you run the case "bt_panu_setup_check.sh" (the others needn't), you must set up the server firstly.
$ ./pan_server_setup.sh


During the server startup, above script will copy the directory server into
server_tmp and set obexd root directory to this temporary dirctory.

server/server directory contains the test data prepared for auto test system,
this includes some pre-created files, sub-directory and one info file contains
the brief information regarding to file count of a given directory, file md5 string.

all pairing request automatically, this is one important file which make
the Bluetooth full automatic test possible.

If you want to stop the server, you can just press Ctrl + C key. After server
aborted, the temporary directory server_tmp will be removed automatically.
