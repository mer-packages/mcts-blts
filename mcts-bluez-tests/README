 Introduction
-----------------------
This suite is to test Bluez stack.
# Usage for each file (under mcts-bluez-tests folder):
sub-folder     usage
src            source file of the cases
data/client    shared scripts and data on the client side for testing
data/server    entire folder should be copied to server machine.
               Run data/server/server_startup.sh on the server to set up
               a daemon to communicate with Client.

# Needed package/command
gcc make  --- common packages for make 
expect    --- for automatic password input when executing 'sudo' command.
pygobject --- python binding for gobject used by pairing script
              data/client/auto_accept_agent
rpm-build --- for packaging
md5sum    --- to check the file consistence after FTP transfering.
On Server, we also need some daemon running: bluetoothd and obexd (for server_startup.sh)

-----------------------
Build and Run
-----------------------
(Suppose you only get the source code and testrunner-lite has been setup on your test machine
 if you have got mcts-bluez-tests RPM, you can directly go to step.4 on testing machine
 if you have not installed the testrunner, you can follow the README of framework)
Steps:
1. We need to use two machine, one is server and another is your testing machine as client. 
   Setup Server environment by three steps as "Test Environment" describe (Please see next section)
   Then, rest steps are on testing machine
2. cd mcts-bluez-tests
3. sh pack.sh    --- It will make and generate the mcts-bluez-tests RPM
4. rpm -ivh mcts-bluez-tests-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm    --- install RPM to your testing machine 
5. cd /usr/share/mcts-bluez-tests/
6. testrunner-lite -f tests.xml -o results.xml


-----------------------
Common Install
-----------------------
./autogen
./configure prefix=/usr
make && make install


-----------------------
Test Environment
-----------------------
1. Setup Server daemon
  copy mct-bluez-tests/data/server folder to server machine, run ./server_startup.sh in its folder.

2. Do confirm your client machine has no old pairing with the server machine, or it will 
  affect most of the cases.

3. Config the environment file on client, the file is data/client/bluetooth_env:
DATA_DIR     --- the place for all cases where RPM install. E.g. /opt/mcts-bluez-tests/
SERV_BD_ADDR --- Server bluetooth MAC address, e.g. "00:0A:94:03:ED:81"
ROOT_PASS    --- Client root password for sudo, e.g. "123456"

4. Do run those cases in 'root' user please.

We will enable more auto cases in the future. thanks!
