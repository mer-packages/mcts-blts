make && make install

Test Environment setup
----------------------
# Note that, pulseaudio daemon is expected to be running in default session user
# So the test cases need to be run in this user to call dbus service. The test
# case will call pa services via su -u <session user> -l <pa call binary/script>.
# If test cases run in root session, there is no problem since su to a normal
# user from root don't require user to input a password. But this assumption 
# will fail if the test case exected from another normal user. Here is a preparation
# for this case before start the test case execution:
# Add bellow line to /etc/sudoers
# <user name>    ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL
