Overview

This package provides a pixel format conversion API for the BLTS project.


Requirements

Building the package requires
  * GNU libc >= 2.4
  * BLTS common library

Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make


Using the pixel format conversion API

#include <blts-pixelformat.h>
#include <linux/videodev2.h> (for pixel format identifiers)

int convert_buffer(int width, int height, const unsigned char* srcbuffer,
		__u32 srcformat, unsigned char** dstbuffer, __u32 dstformat);

Converts the image data in srcbuffer from the source pixel format to the
destination pixel format. After a successful conversion, dstbuffer contains
a pointer to the converted image buffer. The buffer is allocated dynamically
in the conversion function, and must be freed by the caller.

The conversion code is based on the libswscale library of the FFMPEG project,
with modifications to remove unnecessary code. Support for additional V4L2
pixel formats has also been added.

The pixel formats are specified with V4L2 pixel format identifiers. The supported formats are:

V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB332
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB444
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB555
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB565
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB555X
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB565X
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB24
V4L2_PIX_FMT_BGR24
V4L2_PIX_FMT_BGR32
V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB32
V4L2_PIX_FMT_GREY
V4L2_PIX_FMT_Y16
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUYV
V4L2_PIX_FMT_UYVY
V4L2_PIX_FMT_Y41P
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVU420
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVU410
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV422P
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV411P
V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12
V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR8
V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR16
V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGRBG10
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV444
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV555
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV565
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV32

For some pixel formats, only limited conversion support is available:

* V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR8, V4L2_PIX_FMT_SBGGR16, V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGRBG10 (Bayer formats)
  * Can be converted only to V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB24
  * Cannot be used as target formats
* V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB555X, V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB565X (big-endian 15- & 16-bit RGB)
  * Can be converted to different YUV formats and to V4L2_PIX_FMT_RGB24
  * Cannot be used as target formats

Return value

After a successful conversion, dstbuffer contains a pointer to the converted
image, and the function returns the size of the converted image in bytes.

If the conversion fails, an error code is returned:
	-1	The source or destination format is not supported
	-2	Internal conversion error
