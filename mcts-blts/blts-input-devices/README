Overview
========

This package contains several input device functionality tests for generic
Linux-y mobile platforms.

Software Requirements
=====================

Building the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.28
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * libbltscommon-dev >= 0.3.4

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.28
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * libbltscommon >= 0.3.4

Hardware requirements
=====================

Running the tests requires
  * One DUT

Building the package
====================

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use Autotools for configuration and makefile
generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

To build debian package

 $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Running the tests
=================

To run all cases

 $ blts-input-devices-tests

To show list of all cases

 $ blts-input-devices-tests -s

To run a single case

 $ blts-input-devices-tests -e <number of case>

Or to run one case by name

 $ blts-input-devices-tests -en <name of the case>

To use a configuration file

 $ blts-input-devices-tests -C <path of the config>

Cases should be run as root

Test cases
==========

* Input - Enumerate devices
        Enumerates available devices

* Input - Single touch
        Expects user to touch the white boxes on screen one at a time,
        verifies position of touchpoint.

* Input - Multi-touch
        Expects user to place multiple fingers on screen, checks that events
        from multiple touchpoints are received.

Configuration file
==================

Input devices are platform specific. Modify the configuration files with correct
input devices and settings if needed;

# Input devices to test (currently used only by Enumerate devices -test case)
# Give either an absolute path (for example "/dev/input/event1"), or just
# name of the device node (for example, "event1").
[parameter]
	name input_devices
	const "event1 event3 event4"
[end_parameter]

# Used pointer device (currently only touchscreen devices are supported, for
# example mice will not work)
[parameter]
	name pointer_device
	const "event4"
[end_parameter]

# Screen orientation; 0 = TS and screen coordinate system is the same,
# 1 = swap X and Y axis
[parameter]
	name scr_orientation
	const 0
[end_parameter]

# Screen size in pixels
[parameter]
	name scr_size
	const "800x480"
[end_parameter]
