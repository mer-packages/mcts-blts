Overview

This package contains the front-end for running sensor tests, using sensor
plug-ins.

Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.3

Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use the Debian packaging tools for the build; these
will run Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ dpkg-buildpackage

( you may need some combination of '-rfakeroot', '-uc', '-us', etc, depending
  on your system configuration )

Alternatively, the packaging can be skipped by just running with Autotools:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

Installation

Login as root and install the package (dpkg -i [package name])

Running the tests

Test cases are defined by the sensor plug-ins.

Run all tests:
blts-sensors-frontend -p <full path to plugin .so> -C <config file>

Show cases:
blts-sensors-frontend -s -p <full path to plugin .so> -C <config file>

Run single case like nr 1:
blts-sensors-frontend -e 1 -p <full path to plugin .so> -C <config file>

Run a single case with its name (note quotes when there are spaces in the name):
blts-sensors-frontend -en "Test case name" -p <full path to plugin .so> -C <config file>
