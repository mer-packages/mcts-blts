Overview

This package contains functional tests for oFono architecture


Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.3

Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use the Debian packaging tools for the build; these
will run Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ dpkg-buildpackage

( you may need some combination of '-rfakeroot', '-uc', '-us', etc, depending
  on your system configuration )

Alternatively, the packagin can be skipped by just running with Autotools:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

Running the tests

blts-ofono-tests
or
blts-ofono-tests -e [test number]
or
blts-ofono-tests -C [config file]

NOTE: Default config file is installed to /etc/blts/blts-ofono-tests.cnf.

Other

Test case can check and clean test environment of all existing voice calls,
call forwarding rules and other used supplementary services with --cleanup
flag. This is recommended if test environment is not fully pre-configured.
Use -o switch to give proper PIN code if it is not handled with configuration
file.

N900 specific

Use kill-telepathy before tests and enable-telepathy when finished
