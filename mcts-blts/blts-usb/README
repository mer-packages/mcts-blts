Overview

This package contains test runner and kernel modules for usb testing.
Use of included test modules for host and gadget side is required.

Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.3

Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use the Debian packaging tools for the build; these
will run Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ dpkg-buildpackage

( you may need some combination of '-rfakeroot', '-uc', '-us', etc, depending
  on your system configuration )

Alternatively, the packaging can be skipped by just running with Autotools:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

Running the tests

Required hardware

* Supported USB cable
* Device with USB host capability (e.g. PC)
* Device with USB peripheral capability (e.g. Nokia N810/N900) 

How to setup test enviroment

1. Make sure usb cable is disconnected between devices
2. Set up host side (e.g. PC)
3. Set up gadget side (peripheral device)
4. Connect cable
5. Execute tests 

Executing tests

NOTE: Before executing test cases it must be determined if used devices are
capable of acting as peripheral or host. This depends on USB controller chips
of devices and necessary information should be available from device vendors.
Furthermore, current gadget driver implementation is built over MUSB driver
implementation available in Linux kernel. Possible different implementations
by device vendors may cause incompatibility with this test driver. 

$ blts_usb_testrunner -C [config file] -e [test number]

Configuration files

This test asset uses two configuration files: One for generic test execution
options and one for endpoint configuration. Endpoint configuration file is
linked to base configuration files thus only base file path is given as
parameter. Configuration files must be used, as they contain endpoint
configuration for driver.

Currently following example base configuration files are included in the package:

    * blts-usb-testrunner-bulk.cnf
    * blts-usb-testrunner-int.cnf
    * blts-usb-testrunner-isoc.cnf 

The base files are linked to endpoint configuration files and following examples
are provided with test package:

    * ep-configuration-bulk.cfg
    * ep-configuration-int.cfg
    * ep-configuration-isoc.cfg 

NOTE: Supported endpoint configurations differ from device to device and they
should be modified according to test execution requirements. These configuration
files are provided as examples and should not be used as such during proper test
execution. 

Common test execution guidelines

NOTE:
* Default config files are installed to /usr/share/blts-usb-tests/.
* Drivers must be initialized before running other test cases.
* All USB cables MUST be disconnected when executing initializations!

NOTE: All other gadget drivers MUST be unloaded before test execution in
used DUT!

You can use command lsmod to determine which modules are loaded in memory:

$ lsmod

See if some gadget driver is found. For example g_file_storage is a mass
storage module, but this depends on used HW and SW. The module can be unloaded
with following command:

$ modprobe -r g_file_storage

Test cases

Setup and initialization:

* This test is run on host device.
# This test is run on peripheral device. 

 * USB - Setup host driver
     Setup host driver for test execution.
     Extra command line parameters:
           -h <name> : Use <name> as host driver (default: blts_usb_host)

 # USB - Setup peripheral driver
     Setup peripheral driver for test execution.
     Extra command line parameters:
           -p <name> : Use <name> as peripheral driver (default: blts_gadget)

Data transfer:

 * USB - Read test
     Read data from available endpoints.
     Extra command line parameters:
           -h <name> : Use <name> as host driver (default: blts_usb_host)

 * USB - Write test
     Write data to available endpoints.
     Extra command line parameters:
           -h <name> : Use <name> as host driver (default: blts_usb_host)
