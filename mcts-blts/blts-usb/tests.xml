      Build and install instructions
        The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
        The preferred way is to use the Debian packaging tools for the build; these
        will run Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.
        The package builds (from the source tree root) with
         $ dpkg-buildpackage
        ( you may need some combination of '-rfakeroot', '-uc', '-us', etc, depending
          on your system configuration )
        Alternatively, the packagin can be skipped by just running with Autotools:
         $ ./autogen.sh
         $ ./configure
         $ make
      Preconditions
         Host and peripheral device using test modules
      Run instructions
        blts-usb-testrunner
        or
        blts-usb-testrunner -e [test number]
        or
        blts-usb-testrunner -C [config file]
