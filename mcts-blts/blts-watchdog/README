Overview
========

This package contains several Watchdog functionality tests for generic
Linux-y mobile platforms.


Software Requirements
=====================

Building the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.28
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * libbltscommon-dev >= 0.3.4

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.28
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * libbltscommon >= 0.3.4

Hardware requirements
=====================

Running the tests requires
  * One DUT

Building the package
====================

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

To build debian package

 $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

To build RPM package

 $ ./pack.sh

Test cases
==========
   * Watchdog presence check: simple existence check for watchdog
   * Open and close watchdog: open watchdog device node, query information
   * Send keepalive messages: set keepalive timeout, send keepalive messages to
     watchdog for ten second. Note that the device should reboot after the test
     case finishes.

Running the tests
=================

Run as root:

 $ blts-watchdog-tests

Troubleshooting:
 * Ensure that /dev/watchdog exists ('ls -l /dev/watchdog').
   It is possible that the watchdog kernel module is not loaded, so you may need
   to modprobe it (the module is hardware specific).
 * Only one process can access /dev/watchog at a time.
   If you see this message from blts-watchdog-tests;
   '/dev/watchdog seems to exist, but is in use by some other process.'
   There might be some watchdog daemon or some other process using the
   watchdog. To run the tests this daemon/some other process must not be
   running. Use 'lsof /dev/watchdog' to find out who is using the watchdog.
   (Usually this means that you need to tweak init scripts. Just forcibly
   killing the process is not a good idea, as the watchdog will reset the
   device.)
