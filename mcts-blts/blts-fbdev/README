Overview

This package contains functional tests for the generic 'fbdev' frame buffer
devices for Linux mobile platforms.


Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.1

Optionally, a min test framework module will be built if it is present.


Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use the Debian packaging tools for the build; these
will run Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ dpkg-buildpackage

( you may need some combination of '-rfakeroot', '-uc', '-us', etc, depending
  on your system configuration )

Alternatively, the packagin can be skipped by just running with Autotools:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make


Running the tests

USAGE: blts-fbdev-tests [-l mylog.txt] [-e test1,test2...] [-en "my test"] [-s] [-?] [-nc] [-C variation_config.cnf] [-v]
  -l: Used log file, default blts-fbdev-log.txt
  -e: Execute single or multiple selected tests, for example -e 1,4,5.
  -en: Execute test by name, for example -en "My test X"
  -s: Show list of all tests
  -C: Used parameter configuration file
  -?: This message
  -nc: Do not output log to terminal
  -v: Verbose logging
