Overview

This package contains several OpenGL ES 2.0 performance measurements for generic
Linux-y mobile platforms.


Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.1
  * libbltscommon >= 0.2.4
  * GLESv2
  * EGL

Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.
You'll also need the Check test framework (v. 0.9+) to run the unit tests
and use the provided Autoconf scripts.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

To generate debian package

 $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot


Running the tests

Run as root:

 $ blts-opengles2-tests

To see other options for blts-opengles2-tests

 $ blts-opengles2-tests -?
USAGE: ./blts-opengles2-tests [-l mylog.txt] [-e test1,test2...] [-en "my test"]
[-s] [-?] [-nc] [-t execution_time_in_seconds] [-w window_width]
[-h window_height][-d depth] [-c]
-l: Used log file, default blts_gles2_perf.txt
-e: Execute single or multiple selected tests, for example -e 1,4,5.
-en: Execute test by name, for example -en "My test X"
-s: Show list of all tests
-?: This message
-nc: Do not output log to terminal
-t: Maximum execution time of each test in seconds (default: 10s)
-w: Used window width. If 0 uses desktop width. (default: 0)
-h: Used window height. If 0 uses desktop height. (default: 0)
-d: Used window depth. 16, 24 or 32. If 0 uses desktop depth. (default: 0)
-c: Run the tests with minimal compositor

Execute the tests without window manager. Composite window managers, such as
Compiz, slow down execution considerably.
