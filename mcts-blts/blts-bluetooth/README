Overview

This package contains functional tests for Bluez bluetooth stack functionality
for Linux mobile platforms.


Requirements

Running the tests in the package requires
  * linux >= 2.6.15
  * GNU libc >= 2.3
  * Bluez (libbluetooth and kernel modules) >= 4.12
  * Bluez hcidump tool (>= 1.4)


Building the package

The package should build cleanly with GCC 4.x with the mentioned libraries.
The preferred way is to use the Debian packaging tools for the build; these
will run Autotools for configuration and makefile generation.

The package builds (from the source tree root) with

 $ dpkg-buildpackage

( you may need some combination of '-rfakeroot', '-uc', '-us', etc, depending
  on your system configuration )

Alternatively, the packagin can be skipped by just running with Autotools:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make


Running the tests

Show cases:
blts-bluetooth-tests -s

Use config file:
blts-bluetooth-tests -C <config file>

NOTE: Example configuration file is installed to /etc/blts/ and is used
as default.

Run single case like nro 1:
blts-bluetooth-tests -e 1

Run a single case with its name (note quotes when there are spaces in the name):
blts-bluetooth-tests -en "Test case name"

Command line parameter -m (mac_address) can be used to override
mac_address defined in configuration file:

blts-bluetooth-tests -m 01:02:03:04:05:06 -e 3

The list of test cases that require MAC address (server-mac/remote-mac)
to be executed (<-> test case's pair):

connect with L2CAP  					(<-> receive L2CAP connection)
ping-pong transfer with L2CAP  			(<-> receive L2CAP connection)
connect with RFCOMM     				(<-> receive RFCOMM connection)
ping-pong transfer with RFCOMM			(<-> receive RFCOMM connection)
connect with HCI         				(<-> optionally - audit incoming HCI connection)
transfer ACL data with HCI   			(<-> HCI receive ACL data package)
verify name with remote HCI 			(<-> Change name with HCI)
verify class with remote HCI  			(<-> Change class with HCI)
reset connection with HCI  				(<-> optionally - audit incoming HCI connection)
Read HCI controller information remote	(<-> Read HCI controller information local)
Read connected link information remote 	(<-> Read connected link information local)
authentication with pairing as master 	(<-> authentication with pairing as slave)


You can use hciconfig to find out the required mac addresses:

$ hciconfig

This will print out all active bluetooth devices and their addresses. The output is
similar to following:

hci0:   Type: USB
        BD Address: 00:15:83:18:C0:30 ACL MTU: 310:10 SCO MTU: 64:8
        UP RUNNING PSCAN
        RX bytes:1007 acl:0 sco:0 events:30 errors:0
        TX bytes:367 acl:0 sco:0 commands:28 errors:0

Core-Bluetooth authentication with pairing as master
  Parameters: <remote-mac>
   * Perform pairing with another bluetooth device. The device under test initiates
     the pairing.
   * Running this test requires stopping bluetoothd on the test device (as root,
     try
     $ invoke-rc.d bluetooth stop
     or
     $ initctl stop bluetoothd
     depending on distribution).
   * Set the <remote-mac> to the Bluetooth MAC of the other device.
   * Only one device needs to run the test software; the other can be any
     Bluetooth device (that can use the given PIN). In this case, the tester
     needs to enter the PIN manually within the timeout period on the other
     device. The PIN used is "1234". The timeout is 10 seconds for each test
     step. If both ends run the test (one as master, one as slave), this is
     taken care of automatically.
   * This test can be run with "Core-Bluetooth authentication with pairing as slave" as counterpart.
     and is run after it.
   $ blts-bluetooth-tests -en "Core-Bluetooth authentication with pairing as master" -m 00:00:00:00:00:00

Core-Bluetooth authentication with pairing as slave
  Parameters: (none)
   * Perform pairing with another bluetooth device. The device under test waits
     for incoming pairing request.
   * Running this test requires stopping bluetoothd on the test device (as root,
     try
     $ invoke-rc.d bluetooth stop
     or
     $ initctl stop bluetoothd
     depending on distribution).
   * Only one device needs to run the test software; the other can be any
     Bluetooth device (that can use the given PIN). In this case, the tester
     needs to enter the PIN manually within the timeout period on the other
     device. The PIN used is "1234". The timeout is 10 seconds for each test
     step. If both ends run the test (one as master, one as slave), this is
     taken care of automatically.
   * This test can be run with "Core-Bluetooth authentication with pairing as master" as counterpart
     and is run first.
