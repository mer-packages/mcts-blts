# Parameter configuration for blts-bluetooth

# MAC address - used in test cases where another BT device is needed
# NOTE: command line parameter -m (mac_address) overrides this parameter
# List of test cases that require mac_address (<-> pair)
#
# connect with L2CAP  						(<-> receive L2CAP connection)
# ping-pong transfer with L2CAP  			(<-> receive L2CAP connection)
# connect with RFCOMM     					(<-> receive RFCOMM connection)
# ping-pong transfer with RFCOMM			(<-> receive RFCOMM connection)
# connect with HCI         					(<-> e.g. audit incoming HCI connection)
# transfer ACL data with HCI   				(<-> HCI receive ACL data package)
# verify name with remote HCI 				(<-> Change name with HCI)
# verify class with remote HCI  			(<-> Change class with HCI)
# reset connection with HCI  				(<-> e.g. audit incoming HCI connection)
# Read HCI controller information remote	(<-> Read HCI controller information local)
# Read connected link information remote 	(<-> Read connected link information local)
# authentication with pairing as master 	(<-> authentication with pairing as slave)
