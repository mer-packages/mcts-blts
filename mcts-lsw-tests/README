 Introduction
-----------------------
1. Libsocialweb  
Libsocialweb is a data client and server which will fetch data from the social web such as lastfm, Twitter ) in MeeGo. 
The libSocialWeb provide services to get live feed of items related to you and your contacts, and update your status 
on social web. 
Libsocialweb runs as a core daemon process (libsocialweb-core) which loads multiple backends sources for different 
social web services, such as flickr, twitter, last.fm. The libsocialweb core sits on the DBus at the well known name 
com.meego.libsocialweb, and defines several general DBus interfaces for services. By the loaded different backend sources, 
the interfaces are implemented to communicate with services:


2. Geoclue Test Suites
Libsocialweb test suites are developed with focusing on DBus API level testing for different services. The test suites are cover:
core -- test case for common core dbus API
lastfm -- test cases for dbus API with lastfm services

-----------------------
Build and Run
-----------------------
Step1 and Step2 are only required if you start with source package 
If you already have the mcts-lsw-test-1.0.0 package installed in system, plesase move forward with Step3. 

Step1: 
+ Build in meego system, you need install build system and rpmbuild
cd /path/to/<mcts-lsw-tests-source>
$ ./pack.sh 

This will generate mcts-lsw-test-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm

Step2:
+ Install pacakge
$ rpm -ivh mcts-lsw-test-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm --nodeps

Step3:
+ Test environment setup
Refer the section Test environment setup

Step4:
+ Run
$ cd /opt/mcts-lsw-tests
$ testkit-lite -f /usr/share/mcts-lsw-tests/tests.xml


-----------------------
Common Install
-----------------------
./autogen
./configure prefix=/usr
make && make install


-----------------------
Test Environment Setup
-----------------------
1. Check libsocialweb-core is running in the system.
2. Check libsocialweb provider DBUS services. In terminial, run 
$ find /usr/share/dbus-1/services | grep com.meego.libsocialweb


-----------------------
Known Issues
-----------------------
All cases should be run in a Xterm. 
Note: you can report the defects of this test suite to jenny.q.cao@intel.com shaofeng.tang@intel.com

-----------------------
TODO
-----------------------
1. Develop more test cases for other services, such as flickr, twitter.
2. Develop new test cases for key management sub feature of libsocialweb.
