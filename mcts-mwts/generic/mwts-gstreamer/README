        ---------------

INTRODUCTION 

  The mwts-gstreamer tests media playing features of gstreamer.

  Test are done to:
    - audio playback
    - video playback

  Playback can be: 
    - local
    - http-streaming
    - rtsp-streaming
  
  Test scenarios include:
    - Normal playback
    - seeking forwards and backwards, to absolute position
    - long-lasting
    - iterative
    - framerate measurements

  See document MWTS.README under doc directory for detailed general 
  information about mwts test modules.

SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  mwts-gstreamer compiles on MeeGo by executing 'sh buildrpm.sh' if you have missing dependencies,
  add them with 'zypper install <package>', if you need to search after a package you can do that
  with 'zypper search <package>' and get more info with 'zypper info <package>'.

  mwts-gstreamer builds a package on Debian distributions by executing 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot'
  , if you have missing dependencies add them with 'apt-get install <package>'.

   In case of pure compile/install on linux system you can compile and install by  'qmake', 'make',
  'make install' (as root).

   Doxygen API documentation can be generated by running 'doxygen' in mwts-gcamera root directory.


ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Set base paths for local and streaming into /usr/lib/tests/GstreamerTest.conf.

  For streaming playback
    For remote (streaming) playback cases the device need to be connected to the network
    of the streaming server via USB or WLAN. The server IP address has to be 192.168.1.1.
      - rtsp server has to provide the media files,
        e.g. AAC audio files should be located at: rtsp://192.168.1.1/Audio/AAC/
      - http server has to provide the media files,
        e.g. AAC audio files should be located at: http://192.168.1.1/media/Audio/AAC/

EXECUTING TESTS

  Test execution is done normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

TEST RESULTS

  Test results are accessible normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.


MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  SetSource <protocol> <URI>
    Selects the URI for next Play command, protocols: file,http,rtsp
  RunTest
    Starts playing the previously selected URL, returns when playback ends 
  SetFailTimeout <seconds>
    Sets timeout after which playback is stopped by force and case fails
  SetDuration <seconds>
    Sets duration after which playback stops normally.
  SetSeekTimeout <seconds>
    Sets time when seeking is supposed to occur
  SetSeekPosition <seconds>
    Sets absolute timestamp position where to seek
  SetSeekToEndPosition 
    Sets absolute timestamp position where to seek to the end of file.
  SetEvent SeekToEnd|Pause <seconds>
    Sets time when seeking to end or pausing occurs
  SetSecondEvent Continue <seconds>
    Set time when continuing will happen.
  MeasureFramerate
    Sets Framerate measurement on.
  SetChangeVolumeLevel [<up>|<down>|]
    Sets volume changing direction up or down, in default without parameter it is down
    (volume goes between 0-100 % during playback)


KNOWN ISSUES

  Certain testcases do not work on MeeGo regard to the lack of codecs (currently
  available: vorbix, speech, PCM), instead the rehearsal took place on Fremantle.
  Using the server locally (192.168.1.1). The test cases use rtsp protocol needs
  'hinted' audio files due to the media server's requirement.
