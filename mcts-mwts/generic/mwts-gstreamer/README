        ---------------

INTRODUCTION 

  The mwts-gstreamer tests media playing features of gstreamer.

  Test are done to:
    - audio playback
    - video playback

  Playback can be: 
    - local
    - http-streaming
    - rtsp-streaming
  
  Test scenarios include:
    - normal playback
    - seeking forwards and backwards, to absolute position
    - long-lasting
    - iterative
    - framerate measurements


SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  mwts-gstreamer compiles on MeeGo by executing 'sh buildrpm.sh' if you have missing dependencies,
  add them with 'zypper install <package>', if you need to search after a package you can do that
  with 'zypper search <package>' and get more info with 'zypper info <package>'.

  mwts-gstreamer builds a package on Debian distributions by executing 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot'
  , if you have missing dependencies add them with 'apt-get install <package>'.

   In case of pure compile/install on linux system you can compile and install by  'qmake', 'make',
  'make install' (as root).

   Doxygen API documentation can be generated by running 'doxygen' in mwts-gcamera root directory.


DATA FILES

  The data files for the test cases are/will available here: http://testdata.meego.com/p/d/meego_qa/media/index.html
  A streaming server with the data files has to be provided to run the streaming
  playback test cases, to run the local playback test cases the data files have to be downloaded.


ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Settings for base paths for local and streaming in /usr/lib/tests/GstreamerTest.conf.

  For local playback the test data files should be provided on the device.

  For streaming playback
    For remote (streaming) playback cases the device need to be connected to the network
    of the streaming server via USB or WLAN. The server IP address is 192.168.1.1 but can
    be changed see (GstreamerTest.Conf).
      - rtsp server has to provide the media files,
        e.g. AAC audio files should be located at: rtsp://192.168.1.1/Audio/AAC/
      - http server has to provide the media files,
        e.g. AAC audio files should be located at: http://192.168.1.1/media/Audio/AAC/        


EXECUTING TESTS

  mwts-gstreamer test execution is performed normally. Check the "General MWTS testing guide".


TEST RESULTS

  Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/
  Results are named as test cases, test_case_name.result file contains overall information
  about test run and measured values.


MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  SetSource <protocol> <URI>
    Selects the URI for next Play command, protocols: file,http,rtsp
  RunTest
    Starts playing the previously selected URL, returns when playback ends 
  SetFailTimeout <seconds>
    Sets timeout after which playback is stopped by force and case fails
  SetDuration <seconds>
    Sets duration after which playback stops normally
  SetSeekTimeout <seconds>
    Sets seeking timeout
  SetSeekPosition <seconds>
    Sets absolute timestamp position where to seek
  SetSeekToEndPosition 
    Sets absolute timestamp position where to seek to the end of file.
  SetEvent SeekToEnd|Pause <seconds>
    Sets time when seeking to end or pausing occurs
  SetSecondEvent Continue <seconds>
    Set time when continuing will happen
  MeasureFramerate
    Sets Framerate measurement on
  SetChangeVolumeLevel [<up>|<down>|]
    Sets volume changing direction up or down,
    in default without parameter the volume goes between 0-100 % during playback


KNOWN ISSUES

  Certain testcases do not work on MeeGo regard to the lack of codecs (currently
  available: vorbix, speech, PCM), instead the rehearsal took place on Fremantle.
  The test cases use rtsp protocol needs 'hinted' audio files due to the media
  server's requirement.
