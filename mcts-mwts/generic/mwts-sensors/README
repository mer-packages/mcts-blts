        -------------

INTRODUCTION

  Mwts-sensors contains tests for sensors.

  Qt Mobility Sensors API tests are done for validating sensor functionality from API-level.


SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  Mwts-sensors is fetched and compiled normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.


ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Setting up test environment is done normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.


EXECUTING TESTS

  Mwts-sensors test execution is performed normally.  Check doc/MWTS.README.

  NOTE you must move DUT while executing sensor test, when testing sensors metering DUT movement like rotation.

  NOTE if running dataflow test cases for sensors and if you must know if sensors give right values and detect changes, you must must
  run tests two times and change device conditions, because all sensors test just pass, if sensors give a value given it is correct or not.
  Look details information of sensor tests functionality on MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE.


TEST RESULTS

  Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/
  Check doc/MWTS.README.

MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  AccelerometerTestFunc
    Tests that accelerometer gives data. Passed if accelometer sensor gives a value.
  AmbientLightSensorTestFunc
    Tests that Ambient Light sensors gives data. Passed if Ambient Light sensor gives a value.
  CompassTestFunc
    Tests that compass gives data. Passed if compass sensor gives a value.
  MagnetometerTestFunc
    Tests that magnetometer gives data. Passed if magnetometer sensor gives a value.
  OrientationSensorTestFunc
    Tests that orientation sensor gives data. Passed if orientation sensor gives a value.
  ProximitySensorTestFunc
    Test that proximity sensor gives data.  Passed if proximity sensor gives a value, so device is not needed to be covered and uncovered.
  RotationSensorTestFunc
    Tests that rotation sensor gives data. Passed if rotation sensor gives a value. If you don't move DUT, it does not rotate and you get zero values.
    It's better to move DUT while testing.
  TapSensorTestFunc
    Tests that tap sensor gives data. Passed if tap sensor gives a value.
    You must manually tap the screen by you finger or use some kind external device to play finger to get tap sensor values.

Known Issues

  No sensor is verified to work when running tests as user. Cases stuck. Running test as root works.
  Tap sensor is unsure, sometimes work, sometimes not.
