INTRODUCTION

  Mwts-sensors contains tests for sensors.

  Qt Mobility Sensors API tests are done for validating sensor functionality from API-level.


SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  Mwts-sensors is fetched and compiled normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.


ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Setting up test environment is done normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.


EXECUTING TESTS

  Mwts-sensors test execution is performed normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

  NOTE you must move DUT while executing sensor test, when testing sensors metering DUT movement like rotation.
  In some platforms QSensors API gives signal of initial value change even if value is not changed by DUT movement.
  But is some other platforms signal is got only if sensors value is really changed and no initial value signal is got.
  So to ne sure that sensor is not working, you should allways move DUT.

  NOTE if running dataflow test cases for sensors and if you must know if sensors give right values and detect changes, you must must
  run tests two times and change device conditions, because all sensors test just pass, if sensors give a value given it is correct or not.
  Look details information of sensor tests functionality on MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE.

  Test cases should not be run as root, but as normal user, (e.g. meego).
  Running cases as root might work, but may could some troubles as well.

TEST RESULTS

  Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/
  Check doc/MWTS.README.

MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

	InitSensor <sensors_type>
		Creates sensors object and check if it has default backend.
		Following sensors types can be set: AccelerometerType, AmbientLightSensorType,
		CompassType, GyroscopeType, LightSensorType, MagnetometerType, OrientationSensorType,
		ProximitySensorType, RotationSensorType, TapSensorType
	StartTest
		Starts sensors and test. Wait 30 sec for sensor data.

Known Issues

  Test cases are working fine, but at the end are crashing. Overall result is passed, like it can be checked from result file.
