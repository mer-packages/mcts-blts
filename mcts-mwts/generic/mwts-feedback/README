INTRODUCTION

  MWTS-Feeback is test asset for playing feedback effect on device.
  Currently playing haptics (vibration) and audio effect (from file) is supported.

  See document MWTS.README under doc directory for detailed general
  information about mwts test modules.


SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  Look doc/MWTS.README.

  Doxygen API documentation can be generated by running 'doxygen' in mwts-template
  root directory


ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  This section explains specific setup which is necessary to
  execute test cases. Most of the environment setups are
  explained in the MWTS.README.


EXECUTING TESTS

  For local test cases you need to connect to device using ssh connection and
  start MIN tool using command 'min'.
  Run test cases as normal user (e.g. meego) not root.


TEST RESULTS

  Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/
  Result files are named according to test cases, <test_case_name>.result file contains
  overall information about test run and measured values.


MIN SCRIPT FILES

  mwts-feedback.cfg
	 Basic functionality test cases.


MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  StartEffect
	Starts vibra effect
  SetDuration <duration>
	Sets duration of vibra effect
  SetIntensity <intensity>
	Sets intensity of vibra effect
  SetAttackTime <duration>
	Sets fade in duration of vibra effect
  SetAttackIntensity <intensity>
	Sets fade in beginning intensity
  SetFadeTime <duration>
	Sets fade out duration of vibra effect
  SetFadeIntensity <intensity>
	Sets fade out ends intensity


KNOWN ISSUES

	Seems that effect state is not changing to playing, thus it cannot be tested properly.
