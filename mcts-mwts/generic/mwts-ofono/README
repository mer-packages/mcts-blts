        ---------------

INTRODUCTION

The mwts-ofono test package aimed for testtin basic functionalities of libofono-qt API. Currently the tests are designed to address:
	- sim manager 

Test scenarios include:
	- enable (lock) pin, disable (unlock) pin
	- verification of valid, invalid pin code
	- change pin code

SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  mwts-ofono compiles on MeeGo by executing 'sh buildrpm.sh' if you have missing dependencies,
  add them with 'zypper install <package>', if you need to search after a package you can do that
  with 'zypper search <package>' and get more info with 'zypper info <package>'.

  mwts-ofono builds a package on Debian distributions by executing 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot'
  , if you have missing dependencies add them with 'apt-get install <package>'.

   In case of pure compile/install on linux system you can compile and install by  'qmake', 'make',
  'make install' (as root).

   Doxygen API documentation can be generated by running 'doxygen' in mwts-gcamera root directory.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Settings for base paths for local and streaming in /usr/lib/tests/OfonoTest.conf.


EXECUTING TESTS

  mwts-ofono test execution is performed normally. Check the "General MWTS testing guide".


TEST RESULTS

  Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/
  Results are named as test cases, test_case_name.result file contains overall information
  about test run and measured values.


MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  #sim manager
  ChangePin <pin type> <old pin code> <new pin code>
	Changes the pin given by string type.

  EnablePin <pin type> <pin code>
    Activates the lock for the particular pin type. The device will ask for a PIN automatically next time the
    device is turned on or the SIM is removed and re-inserter. The current PIN is required for the operation to succeed.

  DisablePin <pin type> <pin code>
    Deactivates the lock for the particular pin type. The current PIN is required for the operation to succeed.

  VerifyPin <pin type> <pin code>
    Verifies the pin by enabling or disabling with the valid pin code and verifies whether the device realizes its correctness

  VerifyInvalidPin <pin type> <pin code>
    Verifies the pin by enabling or disabling with the invalid pin code and verifies whether the device realizes its correctness

  EnterPin <pin type> <pin code>
	Enters the currently pending pin. The type value must match the
    pin type being asked in the "pin required" (SimInfo) property. This 
	method is implicitly called from the test asset if needed. It is remained
    here only for special cases. 

  SimInfo 
	Prints info about the sim card (locked pin names, pin required)
