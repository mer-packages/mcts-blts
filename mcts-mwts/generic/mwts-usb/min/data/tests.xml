        This test case measures USB network throughput from desktop PC to test device.
        Method
        Iperf network tool is used to measure the performance, the test case makes 7 iterations and one iteration takes 180 seconds.
        Pre-/Post-Conditions
        Test asset is installed to the device and the desktop and MIN master-slave is set up between. Test case is executed in the desktop. Test can be executed as user or root.
        Pass/Fail Criteria
        Test case returns passed and throughput speed is logged into /var/log/tests/.
