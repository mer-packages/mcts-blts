	--------


INTRODUCTION

  mwts-usb is a test package aimed for measuring USB network
  performance and reliability. Verifying USB network speed and
  reliability is important for delivering good end user experience
  on the device.
  
  Test cases are using two different kind of measurements:
   - iperf measurement tool and
   - scp, SSH file transfer
      
  There are send and receive test cases for both measurement
  type.

  See document MWTS.README under doc directory for detailed general 
  information about mwts test modules.

SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  mwts-usb is fetched and compiled normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  In order to execute all tests on mwts-usb, you need following:
     * iperf tool
        * iperf must be installed into a location available in PATH variable
  
     * Master-slave setup between desktop and device (see doc/MWTS.README )
        * Desktop is the master and device is the slave
        
     * Passwordless SSH login to device from desktop
        * Automated Testing images includes ssh-keys (https://projects.maemo.org/trac/testautomation/wiki/sshkeys)
        * To create your own ssh-keys in the desktop
           * Type 'ssh-keygen' in the command line and leave passphrase empty
           * Copy public SSH pair to the device by 'ssh-copy-id root@192.168.2.15'
           * Now you should be able to create SSH connection without password
             
     * Default path for test files is /usr/share/mwts/testdata/
        * Create files using dd:
        * sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/mwts/testdata/
        * sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/share/mwts/testdata/0512k.bin bs=1024 count=5
        * sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/share/mwts/testdata/5MB.bin bs=1024 count=5000
        * sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/share/mwts/testdata/640MB.bin bs=1024 count=640000


EXECUTING TESTS

  Test execution is done normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

TEST RESULTS

  Test results are accessible normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  SendFile ip <address> srcfile <src path> destfile <dest path>
     use scp to transfer file from desktop to device
  ReceiveFile ip <address> srcfile <src path> destfile <dest path>
     use scp to transfer file from device to desktop
  
  mwts-common MIN interface:
  
  StartClientThroughput <server ip> <time>
     uses iperf to measure throughput
  StartServerThroughput
     starts iperf server
  StopThroughput
     stops iperf measuring, if it is still running


KNOWN ISSUES

  - 640MB file transfer might fill up the disk space of device
