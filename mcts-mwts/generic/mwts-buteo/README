  See document MWTS.README under doc directory for detailed general 
  information about mwts test modules.
  
  
SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  Look doc/MWTS.README.
  

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Required HW & SW
    One test device with MeeGo
    Bluetooth hardware for bt syncing
    Internet connection for cloud syncing

  Most of the environment setups are explained in the MWTS.README.

EXECUTING TESTS

  For local test cases you need to connect to device using ssh connection and
  start MIN tool using command 'min'.
 
  First you need to specify your users home directory for the profiles (/usr/lib/tests/ButeoTest.conf). Default user name is 'meego'

  Before running cases you need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable to '/lib'.
  Use 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib' and kill and restart msync-daemon. This is a current workaround and will change in future.

  For cloud syncing you need to se up internet connection first.
  Account credentials need to be set in the config file first (/usr/lib/tests/ButeoTest.conf).

  For bluetooth syncing you should pair your devices beforehand.
  Bluetooth adresses etc need to be set in the config file first (/usr/lib/tests/ButeoTest.conf).

  If you have to use http_proxy outside, please manually add those into example profiles under /etc/sync/profiles/service/
  Example: /etc/sync/profiles/service/google.com.xml
  '<key name="http_proxy_host" value="xxxx" />'
  '<key name="http_proxy_port" value="xxxx" />' 
 
  Otherwise MWTS-Buteo test execution is performed normally. Check the "General MWTS testing guide".

TEST RESULTS

  Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/
  Result files are named according to test cases, <test_case_name>.result file contains
  overall information about test run and measured values.

MIN SCRIPT FILES

  mwts-buteo.cfg 
     Basic functionality test cases
  mwts-buteo-nft.cfg
     Non-functional test cases

KNOWN ISSUES
  Sometimes the dbus-connection to msync-daemon does not work. I that case it might help to kill msyncd process and start again.
