  mwts-location
  -------------

INTRODUCTION 

  The mwts-location test-asset tests basic positioning functionality.
  test asset uses Qt Mobility Location API.

  This document uses the terms "cold fix", "warm fix" and "hot fix" in
  the meaning it is described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_fix

  See document MWTS.README under doc directory for detailed general 
  information about mwts test modules.

SOURCE CODE AND COMPILING

  mwts-location is fetched and compiled normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

  To run the tests the device under test needs to have positioning capabilities and
  it must be located so that it can receive GPS signals from at least 4 satellites

EXECUTING TESTS

  For generic information on how to execute mwts test check doc/MWTS.README.
  
  Asset specific information:
    - before running any "cold fix" test case always reboot the device to make sure that
      the device has not enough information to receive a "warm fix".
    - it is possible that the positioning daemon is not running by default on the device,
      in which case tester needs to start the daemon manually, how to do that
      depends on tested platform

TEST RESULTS

  Test results are accessible normally. Check doc/MWTS.README.

MIN SCRIPTER INTERFACE

  RunLocationColdFix GPS | A-GPS
    Runs "cold fix" test using the specified method.
  RunLocationHotFix <GPS | A-GPS>
    Runs "hot fix" test using the specified method.
  RunGetLocation <GPS | A-GPS> <HOT | COLD>
    Runs get one location fix test using the specified method.
  CalculateDistances
    Calculates center point, median distance, distance to nearest and most faraway point
    from results received by RunGetLocation. This method works only if RunGetLocation has
    been successfully called previously at least 2 times.
