[Accuracy]
# Check and giva all this information for testing accuracy
#Configuration is needed for following parameters:

#- Number of fixes used
Number_of_fixes = 100

#- Allowed radius (meters)
Allowed_radius = 5.0

#- The excat point of the antenna (The center point where all fixes should point)
Antenna_X = 1.0
Antenna_Y = 1.0
Antenna_Z = 1.0

#- Recuired accuracy in psosents
# Prosent if fixex that are inside required accuracy (Allowed_radius)
Required_prosent=90.0
