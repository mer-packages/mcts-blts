[General]
[Accuracy]
# Check and give all this information for testing accuracy
# Configuration is needed for following parameters:

# - Number of fixes used
Number_of_fixes = 100

# - Allowed radius (meters)
Allowed_radius = 5.0

#- The exact point of the antenna (The center point where all fixes should point)
# Use enough decimals to get excact point allmost right in meter!
# latitude should be between -90 to 90 inclusive
Antenna_latitude = 1.0
# longitude should be between -180 to 180 inclusive
Antenna_longitude = 1.0
# altitude specifies the meters above sea level
Antenna_altitude = 1.0

#- Recuired accuracy in psosents
# Prosent if fixex that are inside required accuracy (Allowed_radius)
Required_prosent=90.0



# -------- EXPERIMENTAL ------------------------------------------------------
[TestDriver]
# EXPERIMENTAL
# These settings in below are not used in normal tes
# But are used by EXPERT for Verifying this asset whith similated GPS
# Are you EXPERT of that kind?
# Don't use in normal testing
#
# EMULATED GPS as Testy Driver, instead of real one
# this returns randon values defined by parameters you give below
# Configuration is needed for following parameters:

# Is test driver used instead of real (A)GPS
UseTestDriver=false

# Does emulation return 3D type values instead of 2D
Allow3D=false

#- Allowed radius (meters) from [Accuracy] antenna given positon
# Make it some greater than  [Accuracy/Allowed_radius] if you don't want 100%
# are inside tested accuracy circle
Allowed_radius = 5.25
