Introduction
 
   MWTS-Network contains tests for QT Bearer Management API. Test asset is used for measuring the performance and reliability of wireless LAN and packet switched data transfers.

   Usage of mwts-network is currently restricted to wlan-cases.

   Using QtBearerManagement, you can list, connect and disconnect to already configured and known networks. You cannot configure a new connection.

Usage

Source code and compiling

  mwts-network compiles on a typical red hat/linux distributions by executing sh rpmbuild.sh if you have missing dependencies, add them with

  zypper install

  , if you need to search after a package you can do that with

  zypper search

  and get more info with

  zypper info

  on non-debian/red-hat based linux system you can compile and install by (no dependency check)

  qmake
  make
  make install (as root) 

Requirements for environment

   For troughput measurements, Iperf 2.0.2 must be installed in device and server. With never versions (2.0.4) problems with troughput measurements might appear. 
   In order to execute all tests on mwts-  network, you need to map access point names in the NetworkTest? .cfg (/usr/lib/NetworkTest.cfg)

Executing tests

   MWTS-Network test execution is performed normally. Check the "General MWTS testing guide".

   IMPORTANT! Before running wlan cases, tester must add access point configurations to device. In example if you run cases on a fresh flashed device, debug gives you "invalid configuration" even 
   though the access point is seen.

   Currently the fastest way to do this is to first connect to a access point trough user interface. After that automated tests can be executed.

   Also connman test-scripts can be used if no user interface available

   connman-tests package /usr/lib/connman/test './connect-service <ssid> <passphrase> <encyption> example: ./connect-service MWTS-WPAtkip mwtswpatkip wpa 

Test results

   Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/. Results are named as test cases, test_case_name.result file contains overall information about test run and measured values.

Known Issues

   It should be noted that in Meego platform Bearer Management works on top of connman. In case of trouble user should verify that connman-daemon (connmand) is running. 
   In /usr/lib/connman/test/ is a bunch of python scripts to directly use the connman dbus-interface. In example 'python test-connman services' lists available wlan/psd access points.
