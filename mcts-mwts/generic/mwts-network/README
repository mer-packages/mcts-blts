mwts-network
-----------
Introduction
 
   Mwts-network test asset is created for testing the wireless LAN and Packed switched data connections and data transfers.

   Mwts-network uses Qt Bearer Management provided by Qt Mobility which takes care of connecting to given access point and notifies state changes in active access points. 
   Test asset is used for measuring the performance and reliability of wireless LAN and packet switched data transfers.

   The package is currently intended only for MeeGo? , Maemo devices. In Meego platform bearer management works on top of connman.

Function descriptions

These are MIN interface function used in cases.

   Scan 	                 Scan wireless LAN access points
   Connect <access point> 	 Connect to given access point
   ConnectToDefault 	         Connect to default access point
   Disconnect 	                 Disconnect current session
   Downloadfile <filename>     	 Download file from ftp-server
   UploadFile <filename>          Upload file to ftp-server
   DownloadfileHttp <filename> 	 Download file via http
   ServerStartIperf <time> 	 Start iperf upload measurement while given time
   ServerStartDownload <time> 	 Start iperf download measurement while given time
   Idle <time> 	                 Idle given time

Usage

Source code and compiling

   mwts-multimedia compiles on a typical red hat/linux distributions by executing sh rpmbuild.sh if you have missing dependencies, add them with 'zypper install'

   if you need to search after a package you can do that with 'zypper search'

   and get more info with 'zypper info'

   on non-debian/red-hat based linux system you can compile and install by (no dependency check)	
   qmake
   make
   make install (as root)

Requirements for environment

   For troughput measurements, Iperf 2.0.2 must be installed in device and server. With never versions (2.0.4) problems with troughput measurements might appear. 
   In order to execute all tests on mwts-  network, you need to map access point names in the NetworkTest? .cfg (/usr/lib/NetworkTest.cfg)

Executing tests

   MWTS-Network test execution is performed normally. Check the "General MWTS testing guide".

Test results

   Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/. Results are named as test cases, test_case_name.result file contains overall information about test run and measured values.

Known Issues

   It should be noted that in Meego platform Bearer Management works on top of connman. In case of trouble user should verify that connman-daemon (connmand) is running. 
   In /usr/lib/connman/test/ is a bunch of python scripts to directly use the connman dbus-interface. In example 'python test-connman services' lists available wlan/psd access points.
