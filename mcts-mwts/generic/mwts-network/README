mwts-network
------------


Introduction
 
   MWTS-Network contains tests for QT Bearer Management API.
   Test asset is used for measuring the performance and reliability of
   wireless LAN and packet switched data transfers.

   Usage of mwts-network is currently restricted to wlan-cases.

Usage

Source code and compiling

  mwts-network compiles on a typical red hat/linux distributions by executing
  sh rpmbuild.sh if you have missing dependencies, add them with:

        zypper install

  If you need to search after a package you can do that with:

        zypper search

  And get more info with:

        zypper info

  on non-debian/red-hat based linux system you can compile and
  install by (no dependency check):

        qmake
        make
        make install (as root)


Requirements for environment

   For troughput measurements, Iperf 2.0.2 must be installed in device
   and in server. With never versions (2.0.4) problems with troughput
   measurements might appear.

   In order to execute all tests on mwts-network, you need to map access point
   names in the config file (/usr/lib/tests/NetworkTest.cfg).

   For PSD-cases you need to set the service name and internet access point
   to the config file (/usr/lib/tests/NetworkTest.cfg) befofe executing tests.
   The internet access point name is usually 'internet' and the psd_network name
   can be checked with using connman test-scripts. To list all available
   services give command:

        /usr/lib/connman/test/test-connman services

   The location where files are uploaded from or downloaded to, is specified
   in the config file (/usr/lib/tests/NetworkTest.cfg) with local_path key
   in [FTP] section.

   Test files can be created with 'dd' command. To create a 10MB test file
   use the following command:

        dd bs=1024 count=10000 if=/dev/urandom of=10MB.bin

   For test files with different sizes modify the count arguments and
   file names accordingly.


Executing tests

   MWTS-Network test execution is performed normally.
   Check the "General MWTS testing guide".


Test results

   Test results can be found from device in directory /var/log/tests/.
   Results are named as test cases, test_case_name.result file contains
   overall information about test run and measured values.


Known Issues

   It should be noted that in Meego platform Bearer Management works on top
   of connman. In case of trouble user should verify that
   connman-daemon (connmand) is running.

   In /usr/lib/connman/test/ is a bunch of python scripts to directly use
   the connman dbus-interface. In example 'test-connman services'
   lists available wlan/psd access points.

   By default connman sets the AutoConnect property to true for connected access
   points. This may cause problems, if connman automatically connects to some
   access point after test script disconnects.

   The AutoConnect feature is set to false for every access point that is
   connected with mwts-network asset. But there might be access points that
   have been connected by other means and those might have the AutoConnect
   feature set to true.
